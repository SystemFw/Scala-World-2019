Slides for my talk at Scala World Summit 2019. You can look at them online at https://systemfw.github.io/Scala-World-2019/#/ (use the spacebar to advance). The video for the talk is [here]().
The images in the slides were drawn as ASCII diagrams with http://asciiflow.com, and converted to cool "hand-written" PNGs with http://shaky.github.bushong.net
